# One field is done for you as an example. Use df.describe() from Part 1:

#   rotational_speed_rpm  1170  - 2287     torque_nm       9.5   - 67.0     tool_wear_min  0 - 240
# Options for how wide to make the limits:
#   Option A: exactly the training min/max    -> safest for the model, but rejects some real readings
#   Option B: physical limits of the machine  -> e.g. torque 0-100 Nm, tool wear 0-300 min (needs domain input)
# THINK: what should happen to a reading that is possible but outside the training data? Reject? Warn?
#ANS: A reading that is physically possible but outside the training data should usually be accepted but flagged or logged as a warning, because the model may be less reliable on unfamiliar values.
